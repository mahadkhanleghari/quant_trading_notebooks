# Terminology and Definitions

## Cross-Asset Alpha Engine Glossary

### Alpha Generation Terms

**Alpha**
: Excess return generated by a trading strategy relative to a benchmark, representing the value added by active management.

**Cross-Asset Alpha**
: Alpha generated by exploiting relationships and inefficiencies across multiple asset classes (equities, bonds, commodities, currencies).

**Regime-Aware Alpha**
: Alpha generation that adapts to different market conditions or regimes, using different models or parameters for different market environments.

**Information Ratio**
: Risk-adjusted measure of alpha generation, calculated as excess return divided by tracking error (standard deviation of excess returns).

### Market Regime Terms

**Market Regime**
: Distinct periods in financial markets characterized by different risk-return dynamics, volatility patterns, and asset correlations.

**Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**
: Statistical model assuming that market observations are generated by an underlying, unobservable regime state that follows a Markov process.

**Regime Detection**
: Process of identifying and classifying different market regimes using statistical or machine learning methods.

**Regime Transition**
: The process of moving from one market regime to another, often triggered by economic events or structural changes.

**State Space Model**
: Mathematical framework where the system state (regime) is not directly observable but can be inferred from observable variables.

### Feature Engineering Terms

**Technical Features**
: Quantitative indicators derived from price and volume data, including momentum, volatility, and mean reversion signals.

**Daily Microstructure-Inspired Features**
: Features inspired by microstructure concepts but computed from daily OHLCV bars only. Includes VWAP deviations, volume anomalies, and daily price patterns. Note: True intraday trading patterns and bid-ask dynamics require intraday/tick data, which is not used in the current experiment.

**Cross-Asset Features**
: Indicators that capture relationships between different asset classes, such as correlations, volatility spillovers, and risk sentiment.

**Feature Importance**
: Measure of how much each feature contributes to model predictions, typically calculated using methods like Gini importance or permutation importance.

**Z-Score Normalization**
: Statistical technique to standardize features by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, ensuring features have zero mean and unit variance.

### Statistical and ML Terms

**Random Forest**
: Ensemble machine learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, providing robustness and feature importance rankings.

**Ensemble Method**
: Machine learning technique that combines predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance and reduce overfitting.

**Walk-Forward Validation**
: Time series validation technique where models are trained on historical data and tested on subsequent out-of-sample periods.

**Cross-Validation**
: Model validation technique that divides data into multiple folds to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.

**Overfitting**
: Phenomenon where a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data due to excessive complexity.

### Risk Management Terms

**Value at Risk (VaR)**
: Statistical measure estimating the maximum potential loss of a portfolio over a specific time horizon at a given confidence level.

**Expected Shortfall (ES)**
: Risk measure that estimates the expected loss beyond the VaR threshold, also known as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).

**Maximum Drawdown**
: Largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value, representing the worst-case loss scenario during the analysis period.

**Sharpe Ratio**
: Risk-adjusted return measure calculated as excess return divided by standard deviation of returns.

**Market Neutrality**
: Portfolio construction approach that maintains approximately zero net market exposure (beta ≈ 0) to isolate alpha from market movements.

### Portfolio Construction Terms

**Position Sizing**
: Process of determining the appropriate allocation to each asset in a portfolio based on expected returns, risk, and constraints.

**Risk Parity**
: Portfolio construction approach where each asset contributes equally to total portfolio risk, typically achieved by inverse volatility weighting.

**Kelly Criterion**
: Mathematical formula for optimal position sizing that maximizes long-term growth rate based on win probability and payoff ratios.

**Gross Exposure**
: Sum of absolute values of all portfolio positions, representing total capital deployed regardless of direction.

**Net Exposure**
: Sum of all portfolio positions considering direction (long minus short), representing overall market exposure or beta.

### Market Data Terms

**OHLCV**
: Standard market data format containing Open, High, Low, Close prices and Volume for each time period.

**VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**
: Average price weighted by volume, representing the average execution price for the trading period.

**Bid-Ask Spread**
: Difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask).

**Market Impact**
: Price movement caused by executing a trade, typically modeled as a function of trade size and market liquidity.

**Slippage**
: Difference between expected execution price and actual execution price, caused by market movement and liquidity constraints.

### Asset Class Definitions

**SPY**
: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, tracking the S&P 500 index and representing large-cap US equity exposure.

**QQQ**
: Invesco QQQ Trust, tracking the NASDAQ-100 index and representing technology-heavy large-cap growth stocks.

**IWM**
: iShares Russell 2000 ETF, tracking small-cap US equity exposure.

**VIX**
: CBOE Volatility Index, measuring implied volatility of S&P 500 options and serving as a "fear gauge" for market sentiment.

**TLT**
: iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, representing long-term US government bond exposure and interest rate sensitivity.

**GLD**
: SPDR Gold Trust, providing exposure to gold prices and serving as an inflation hedge and safe-haven asset.

**DXY**
: US Dollar Index, measuring the value of the US dollar against a basket of major foreign currencies.

**USO**
: United States Oil Fund, tracking crude oil prices and representing commodity exposure.

### Performance Metrics

**Annualized Return**
: Return scaled to represent performance over a full year, calculated as (1 + period_return)^(252/periods) - 1 for daily data.

**Volatility**
: Standard deviation of returns, typically annualized by multiplying daily volatility by √252.

**Win Rate**
: Percentage of trading periods with positive returns.

**Calmar Ratio**
: Risk-adjusted return measure calculated as annualized return divided by maximum drawdown.

**Sortino Ratio**
: Modified Sharpe ratio that only considers downside volatility in the denominator, focusing on harmful volatility.

### Execution Terms

**TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)**
: Execution strategy that spreads trades evenly over time to minimize market impact.

**Implementation Shortfall**
: Difference between the decision price and the final execution price, including market impact and timing costs.

**Participation Rate**
: Percentage of total market volume that a trading algorithm is allowed to consume during execution.

**Transaction Costs**
: Total cost of executing trades, including commissions, bid-ask spreads, market impact, and opportunity costs.

### Statistical Terms

**Autocorrelation**
: Correlation of a time series with a delayed copy of itself, measuring the persistence of trends or mean reversion.

**Stationarity**
: Statistical property where the mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure remain constant over time.

**Heteroskedasticity**
: Condition where the variance of errors is not constant across observations, common in financial time series.

**Multicollinearity**
: High correlation between predictor variables that can cause instability in model coefficients.

**P-Value**
: Probability of observing results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

### Backtesting Terms

**In-Sample Period**
: Historical data used to train and optimize models, also known as the training set.

**Out-of-Sample Period**
: Historical data reserved for testing model performance, simulating real-world deployment conditions.

**Look-Ahead Bias**
: Error in backtesting where future information is inadvertently used to make historical decisions.

**Survivorship Bias**
: Bias that occurs when analysis only includes assets that survived the entire period, ignoring delisted or failed assets.

**Data Snooping**
: Bias that results from testing multiple strategies on the same dataset and selecting the best-performing one.
